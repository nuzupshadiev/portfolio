                    Hello, I'm an undergraduate student at KAIST, majoring in computer science and minoring in business and technology management. I'm currently a software engineer at Calici, a bioinformatics company focused on revolutionizing drug development through AI technology. At Calici, we've developed Pharmaco-Net, a web-based cloud platform that utilizes AI to analyze big data and predict complex protein structures, ultimately contributing to efficient drug development. I'm passionate about being part of a team dedicated to creating a safer society and providing better treatment options for patients.
